            <h2>Conditions I like to work in</h2>
            <p>I like a quiet work environment. I find it hard to do work that requires concentration if there is a lot of noise and distraction.</p>
            <p>I like to be able to determine or bring my work equipment if possible.</p>
            <p>I like to work in a fresh air environment, with plants and open windows.</p>
            <p>I also like to work in a environment which contains natural elements like wood or a garden.</p>
            <p>I also like a work environment filled with productive people and maintaining a productive vibe.</p>

            <h2>The times/hours I like to work</h2>
            <p>I am trying to start my workday at 8am. I usualy start my day at 6am and commute to work. While commuting I usualy try to keep up to date with the web. After I arrive I usualy work on side projects or algorithm challenges for about an hour.</p>
            <p>I work best in the morning, but if I look after myself I can stay productive most of the day. Productivity will usualy decline after about 10-12 hours.</p>
            <p>I don't mind being contacted at any time, but will likely only respond during week daytimes.</p>

            <h2>The best ways to communicate with me</h2>
            <p>I love direct communication. It usualy helps keeping misunderstandings and communication overhead to a minimum.</p>
            <p>Else I prefer being contacted by email if it is work related. This helps me manage my tasks better. For private communication WhatsApp gets the job done.</p>
            <p>In case of emergency do not hesitate to call me.</p>

            <h2>The ways I like to recieve feedback</h2>
            <p>I'd rather have difficult conversations than things be unspoken or inauthentic, so just be straight with me.</p>
            <p>I like receiving feedback face-to-face</p>
            <p>I see all feedback as a learning opportuniy so I like any feedback to include examples and also suggestions on how I or it could be done better or different.</p>

            <h2>Things I need</h2>
            <p>O² and H²O</p>
            <p>Authenticity and people around me accepting their and others mistakes.</p>

            <h2>Things I struggle with</h2>
            <p>I find it extremely difficult to be able to work when having headache. If I find myself with headache I usualy try to sleep for half an hour or take some painkillers if the headache is not very dominant.</p>
            <p>I sometimes struggle with remembering things, you could say I am scatterbrained. To combat this I usualy keep lots of lists, which help me remember everything.</p>
            <p>If I don't understand the bigger picture or usecase behind what we are doing I find it hard to make smart decisions in the process.</p>
            <p>Cache invalidating and naming things, also unnecessary process overhead. Minimum viable process anyone?</p>

            <h2>Things I love</h2>
            <p>I like hearing what others are working on and connecting up the dots of what we are working on in total.</p>
            <p>I love pair programming and learning together as an experience.</p>
            <p>I love working on silly little side projects. Testing new frameworks or features. I am really curious about all javascript.</p>
            <p>If I find something I dont understand I will get to the bottom of it, to deepen my understanding of things.</p>

            <h2>Other things to know about me</h2>
            <p>While beeing introverted, I am an open person and you can talk to me about pretty much anything.</p>
            <p>If problems arise in a project I will try very hard to keep pushing the objective instead of blaming others. Mistakes happen to everyone, its how we deal with it that makes or breaks a good team.</p>
            <p>I like to resolve problems as soon as they appear, be it work related or personal.</p>
            <p>I like to be friends with my coworkers if possible. This helps me communicate more directly. Also achieving this requires usualy more community activity than the usual work projects.</p>
